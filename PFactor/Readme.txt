A Prime Factor Generator up to 10^15.
© 2008 Michael M. Ross

Output composites and their prime factors in a selected range to text files.

1. Save the program (PFactors.exe) to a folder.
2. Specify From and To values.
3. Select the range (number of values*) for each text file.
4. Click Start.

The first number is the composite and the remaining numbers are its prime factors. (For example, 693 = 11 * 7 * 3 * 3 shows the unique prime factorization of 693. The same factor is shown as many time as required to create the sum.)

*If you accept the default of 100,000, that means 100,000 values (and lines) will be written to each file.
